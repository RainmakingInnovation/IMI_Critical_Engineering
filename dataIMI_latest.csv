2,Hydrostor,Underwater compressed air energy storage,"Underwater compressed air energy storage. It stores compressed air underwater and in a pressurized state and releases it to generate electricity as need be. Electricity runs an air compressor which converts the electrical energy into compressed air, which is pressurized to be stored at a certain depth inside accumulators. The air displaces the water in the accumulators and is held until electricity is needed by the consumer. To satisfy the need for electricity the system reverses the air flow allowing the weight of the water to force the air back to the surface under pressure, thus driving a generator, efficiently converting the energy in the air back into electricity for the consumer.",hydrostor.ca,,,"Renewable Energy Tech > Horizontal > Energy Storage > Compressed Air

The technology is compatible with intermittent renewable power, avoids (or reduces) demand for fossil fuel extraction, and reduces the cost of achieving net-zero.",parallelcarbon.com,United Kingdom,Europe,Air Pollution Management Tech > Carbon Management > Carbon Capture > Diversified > Flue Gas Emissions,Carbon-to-value,Carbon Capture,Carbon Economy ,(6) Capture as-a-Service ,,,,2021,Yes,Pre-seed,,,,Deep Science Ventures,,,,Nascent,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,0.2,0.3,,0,0,0.7,,0,0.06,Nascent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
607,NeoCarbon,Provider of solutions for direct carbon capture,"NeoCarbon uses existing infrastructure in the form of cooling towers to perform DAC at up to 10x lower costs and time, which makes DAC mass-market ready.
Indeed, millions of existing cooling towers around Europe continuously circulate massive amounts of air to remove heat from industrial plants and buildings. By efficiently retrofitting those towers, we remove the carbon dioxide from all this air at very low additional cost. Several billion tons of CO₂ could be captured this way annually, a huge share of humanity’s long-term needs.",neocarbon.tech,Switzerland,Europe,Air Pollution Management Tech > Carbon Management > Carbon Capture > Diversified,Carbon-to-value,Carbon Capture,Carbon Economy ,(6) Capture as-a-Service ,,,,2021,Yes,Seed,,,,Antler,,,,Nascent,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,0.2,0.3,,0,0.2,0.7,,0,0.2,Nascent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Rgees,Phase Change Material based Thermal Energy System,"RGEES specializes in design &amp; manufacture of temperature control and thermal energy storage (TES) systems with Phase Change Material (PCM). savENRG Phase Change Material (PCM) develops products which are non-toxic, inorganic and organic products engineered for Thermal Energy Storage. Energy is stored as a combination of sensible and latent heat. During the process of phase change between solid-liquid, thermal energy is absorbed or released at a constant temperature which provides the unique capability to control temperature. Current range of products are mostly used as Cold Chain refrigerants in wide temperature range, Electronic enclosures heat sink, PCM-based Solar thermal energy storage solutions etc.",https://rgees.com,,,Energy Storage Tech > Energy Storage System > Thermal > Pumped Heat,Smart Balancing Solutions,Other Alternative Storage - Thermal,,,,,,2009,No,Unfunded,,,,,,,,Nascent,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,1,0.3,,0,0,0.7,,0,0.3,Nascent,United States,info@rgees.com,,Harshul Gupta; Co-Founder & CEO; http://linkedin.com/in/harshulgupta; Ex-VP of Engineering Services- Alltec Corporation Kharkhov Technical University,,http://linkedin.com/in/harshulgupta,http://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/p?f_CC=1217750,,,No,,,,,No,,,,,No,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,200,"May 28, 2022",http://linkedin.com/company/rgees,https://twitter.com/pcm_tweets,http://facebook.com/rgees,,https://tracxn.com/companies/2wVXh89an31vPJZK3TZbjaBI7FVrVOEu1AQ7DnLm8T8/rgees.com,"Jul 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,9.95,,,"Consumer

,Soliculture,Solar panels for converting sunlight into red light for optimization of photosynthesis in plants,"Soliculture provides solar panels based on Lumo technology to convert sunlight into the red light for the optimization of photosynthesis of plants. Lumo panels has a low density of silicon photovoltaic (PV) strips arranged periodically on a panel of glass, allowing light to transmit between the strips. A thin layer of luminescent material(dye) is adhered to the backside of the glass, enhancing light quality by converting green light to red light. The panel is suitable for the cultivation area of greenhouses. It also supplies standard technology panels also which it claims traps 100% of sunlight and converts the same into electric energy using photovoltaic technology.",http://www.soliculture.com/,,,"Energy Efficiency Tech > Lighting Products > LED > Smart Lights > Commercial > Agriculture

,P2 Power,New Zealand’s peer to peer energy provider using solar power,"P2 Power developed the technology, named SolarShare, to enable those who don’t have solar panels to buy solar power directly from those who contribute excess amounts to the grid. SolarShare works by sourcing local solar-power generators, such as neighboring households or businesses. When spare power is exported into the network, their meter records it and P2 Power matches it to another customer who is using power at the same time. When there’s not enough local power to meet the customer’s needs, the rest is supplied via traditional power stations. During summer when solar generation is high they guarantee at least 7% of consumers power use will be charged at the P2P rate.",http://p2power.co.nz,New Zealand,APAC,"Smart Grid > Energy Trading Platforms > P2P
